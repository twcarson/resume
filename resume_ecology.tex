	{\textbf{Biodiversity Inventory of Under-documented area in Kern County}} \hspace*{5mm} \\
	\vspace*{-5pt}\begin{itemize}	\itemsep 0pt
		\item Conducted an ongoing, self-directed biodiversity inventory of an under-documented region along the South Fork of the Kern River Valley, roughly corresponding with the bounds of Onyx, CA.
		\item Recorded roughly 1000 observations using iNaturalist, including over 150 unique plant species.  Created and maintained a checklist page for the region to track likely and confirmed taxa.
		\item Documented several rare and uncommon species, as well as several species at the extreme edges of their known range.
		\item Relocated rare species based on the descriptions and geolocations provided in herbarium collections.
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace*{0mm}
	
	{\textbf{Dichotomous Key Tools (work in progress)}} \hfill {\sl Python} \\
	\vspace*{-5pt}\begin{itemize}	\itemsep 0pt
		\item Designed and implemented a code base to introduce useful functionalities to dichotomous keys, including interactive key traversal, key filtering based on arbitrary data (for example: geolocation, native status, etc), and nearest ancestor of two leaves. 
		\item Created key parser for plaintext from Jepson eFlora pages, with the goal of implementing webpage parsers for Jepson and other popular online floras.
		\item Goals for the project include creating a web interface and integrations with other online tools such including iNaturalist and Calflora.

	{\textbf{Phonological Analysis of Uyghur Language}} \hfill {\sl Python, Excel}
	\vspace*{-5pt}\begin{itemize}	\itemsep 0pt 
		\item Implemented corpus data processing tools including regex search tool, Arabic/Latin transliterator, and text processing.
		\item Performed statistical analysis of written Uyghur corpus, analyzing properties of vowel harmony.
		\item Constructed a web scraper using Python's Scrapy module to generate a corpus of written Uyghur.
